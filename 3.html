<p>was a German bodybuilder and showman. Born in KÃ¶nigsberg, Sandow became interested in bodybuilding at the age of ten during a visit to Italy. He studied under strongman Louis Durlacher in the late 1880s and, on Durlacher's recommendation, competed in a series of matches against leading figures in the sport such as Charles Sampson and Henry McCann. In 1901 he organised what is believed to be the world's first major body building competition. Set in London's Royal Albert Hall, Sandow judged the event alongside author Arthur Conan Doyle and athlete/sculptor Charles Lawes-Wittewronge.
